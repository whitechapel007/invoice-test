## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone
cd invoice-app
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up Firebase**

   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Authentication and Firestore
   - Copy your Firebase config

4. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

5. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Start the Socket.IO server** (in a separate terminal)

```bash
npm run server
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
